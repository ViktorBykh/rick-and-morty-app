  <summary>Reasons for the making of</summary>

_~~*Burp Hey there, you know, this whole project thingy was done just for kicks and giggles.
Belch So, if you happen to be perusing this message right now, are you're one of them fancy folks from Dimension C-137, huh? Wink~~_

~~Look, the real reasons for the 'making of' anything are pretty pointless when you think about it. See, the universe is basically random chaos strung together by temporary forces beyond our control or understanding.
So when people try to ascribe some lofty 'reasons' or purpose to their meaningless machinations,
it's all just a story they tell themselves to feel better about the inevitability of death and their own microscopic insignificance in the grand, absurd scheme of things.
But I'll humor you - the reasons those chuckleheads churn out their 'making of' crap is probably something like: they need that sweet, sweetvalidation and attention their fragile egos crave.
Or maybe their tiny lizard brains still find some primitive satisfaction in showing everyone how they wasted their time slapping together more useless dreck for the rest of us saps to consume.
Who knows, who cares! It's all just noise drowning out the anguished cries of a universe built on suffering. Now let's go see if we can scrounge up some plutonium to fuel this damn thing~~
